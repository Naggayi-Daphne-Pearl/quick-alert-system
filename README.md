## Live Demo

- [Project Link](https://quick-alert-system.vercel.app/)
- [GITHUB REPOSITORY](https://github.com/Naggayi-Daphne-Pearl/quick-alert-system)

## About Our System
- Our system detects preset temperature and smoke ranges and sends notifications to responsible individuals, even if they are not
nearby. 
-The system expects a response to stop sending alerts. If no action is taken, it escalates the alert by making a phone call.

## Project Requirements 
- Dht 11: Measures temperature and sends the data to the ESP32.
- Esp32: Processes data from the DHT11 and communicates with the SIM800L module.
- SIM800L: Sends SMS notifications and can make phone calls.
- Connection wires: Connect components.
- LM2596 DC-DC 3A Buck  Step-Down(optional): Converts high voltage to low voltage required to power our components.
- Breadboard: For assembling the circuit during development and testing.
